THE REMIND COPYRIGHT

1. REMIND refers to the entire set of files and documentation in the
REMIND package.

2. REMIND is Copyright 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 by David Skoll, except where
noted in individual files.

3. You may use REMIND for free, and may freely distribute it, providing
you do not charge the recipients to whom you distribute REMIND.

4. This means that if you distribute REMIND:

- You may not charge more than cost for distribution media.
- If you run a BBS or network service, you cannot charge more than
  the regular access fee for REMIND.  That is, REMIND must be accessible
  at the basic BBS access rate, with no surcharge.
- You may not charge users support fees for REMIND.
- No other fees may be levied for REMIND.
- You cannot use REMIND to solicit donations.

5. You may modify REMIND.  However, you must clearly indicate such
modifications when you distribute REMIND, and must tell the recipients
of the modified version that it is modified.  Place that notice in the
WHATSNEW.xx file.

6. You may incorporate parts of REMIND into your own programs, providing
you do not sell these programs.  You must clearly indicate that the
parts of REMIND you have incorporated are Copyright 1990, 1991, 1992,
1993 by David Skoll.  These programs can be distributed according to
the terms of paragraphs 3 and 4.

7. I will attempt to support REMIND as much as possible.  However,
REMIND is supplied on an "as-is" basis with no warranty.  You use it
at your own risk.  I am not responsible for any damages caused by the
use or misuse of REMIND.

8. If you wish to contribute ideas or money to help the production of
software like REMIND, you can reply to the address shown at the end of
this file.  Note that you are under no obligation to send me money.
If you don't donate, you have full rights to use REMIND just as if you
had donated.  If you do donate, you get a big thank-you, but no
special rights.  However, you will have helped support the production
of software like REMIND.  Should you wish to donate, the suggested
amount is $18.00 (Canadian)

If you wish to incorporate Remind into a commercial product, or to
charge support fees for products incorporating Remind, contact
me for licensing arrangements.
